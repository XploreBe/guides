# Dependency Track
Dependency Track is a tool that allows centralised monitoring of vulnerabilities imported through the dependencies of your applications. This tool bases his security analysis solely on a provided SBOM.

An SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is a "list of ingrediÃ«nts" that make up your software. This list is compared to a set of CVE reports to analyse the included vulnerabilities and their severity.

## Why would you need an SBOM?
Supply chain attacks are on the rise. It is important that component providers also provide this format to ensure a certain level of security. The American government requires software suppliers to include an SBOM to ensure the safety and integrity of the components they are providing.

## Setting up Dependency-Track
The application itself has a straightforward and well-documented setup:
- Deployment through WAR (deprecated): https://docs.dependencytrack.org/getting-started/deploy-exewar/
- Deployment through a docker container: https://docs.dependencytrack.org/getting-started/deploy-docker/

The application will run 2 separate docker containers by default, frontend and backend separately. It's recommended that you also provide the application with its dedicated database.

I've set up a docker-compose script that will help you start out. It contains the frontend, backend and dedicated postgres DB:

## Usage
Dependency-Track contains several useful features that can be helpful in tracking vulnerabilities within your infrastructure.

### Dashboard
Grafana-like dashboard showing the general status of your applications. It indicates the total of vulnerable components, audited vulnerabilities, release overview of vulnerabilities, ...

### Projects
List overview of your existing applications and their analysed version. It gives a representation of the severity for each application. Each application is assigned a risk score along with the total amount of vulnernabilities. 

The risk score is a calculation based on severity and likeliness of all the detected vulnerabilities.

### Components
Useful list view that allows specific searches on vulnerabilities and components. Most common usage would be to check if you're vulnerable to a specific CVE.

### Vulnerabilities
Shows which vulnerabilities are present within your infrastructure. This interface also allows maintenance of these vulnerabilities, for example suppressing certain vulnernabilities

## Generating SBOMs
The generation of an SBOM can be implemented withing your build framework:
- Gradle: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gradle-plugin
- Maven: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin

These plugins will generate an SBOM while which you can (automatically) upload into Dependency-Track. Jenkins has a dedicated plugin to automate the upload of the generated file: https://plugins.jenkins.io/dependency-track/
